                <p> Welcome to my little corner of the universe that’s always overflowing with new ideas. I invite you to take a stroll through my previous and current projects and join me on the journey of dreaming up even more ideas. </p>
                <h3> Purpose and Goals </h3> <!--Section Header -->
                <p> Life can be challenging, but a difficult journey doesn’t have to define one’s happiness. My mission is to help others understand and navigate the obstacles they face and discover ways to build happier, healthier lives. By openly sharing my own struggles and the lessons I’ve learned, I aim to demonstrate that positive change is not only possible but crucial for fostering a healthier and happier life. Through sharing what has worked for me, I hope others are able to find the inspiration they need to discover what works best for them. Ultimately, my greatest fulfillment comes from working individually and collaborating with others to create resources that help others find more joy, balance, and well-being in their own lives. </p> <!--Purpose and Goals Section -->
                <h3>A Quote I Love: </h3>
                <blockquote>“Because it’s our first life, worries are aplenty, and anxiety, too. Because it’s our first life, it’s precious. Because it’s our first life, nobody knows what’ll happen, even in five minutes.” <br> -- Hwang Bo-Reum; Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop </blockquote> <!--Quote; I would like to later italicize the book title-->
