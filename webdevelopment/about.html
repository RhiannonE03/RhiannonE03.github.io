                <h3> Introduction</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Rhiannon. I am 23 years old, an undergraduate learning design and technology student, and a full-time corporate employee. Driven by my interest in psychology and wellness, I completed an associate’s degree in Social and Behavioral Science in 2022. Before starting my bachelor’s studies, I took time to reflect on my priorities and personal growth. During that period, I worked as a substitute teacher and ultimately decided to continue pursuing my passion for well-being by studying psychology. In 2025, my plans evolved, and I transitioned to studying graphic design and learning technologies. After I finish my bachelor’s, I intend to further my education by earning a master’s degree in learning technologies and design. Outside of work and school, I enjoy reading, cooking, baking, and snuggling with my cats while watching tv. As a former competitive dancer of 14 years, I also love staying active through long walks and hikes, Pilates, and yoga. </p>
