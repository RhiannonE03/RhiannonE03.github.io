                <p class="reflection-p-1">Despite only being 23, my work history spans back 11 years. At the age of 12, I received my first company-paid position as an assistant dance teacher at the studio where I was a student. In my early teenage years, I began working at fast-food restaurants. By the time I reached 16, I had taken on the role of night shift manager at the fast-food institution where I worked. At 18, I broke out of the food industry and landed a role as an operations manager for Buckle. When I first moved to Columbia and started school, I left Buckle and spent some time working for Walmart. In 2022, my grandmother and I moved to Florida, where I began substitute teaching for the Polk County School District. However, after just one year, life brought me back to Columbia when I began working towards building a more stable life.</p>
                <p class="reflection-p-2">After returning to Columbia, I began what I hope will be a long career at the University of Missouri. In late 2023, I was hired as a patient service representative. After two wonderful years with the Missouri Orthopaedic Institute, I decided to seek a new role better aligned with my future career goals. I explored multiple job openings, but in the end, it was a role I hadn't originally pursued that ultimately turned out to be the perfect fit for me. My new role as a procurement and asset specialist marks my first move into a more formal corporate setting and an important step toward the career I am currently working toward.</p>
                <p class="reflection-p-3">Once I complete my bachelor’s degree in Educational Studies with a focus on information science and learning technologies in December 2026, I intend to further my education by beginning a master’s program in August of the following year. My current goal is to earn my master’s degree in Learning Technologies and Design, with the intention of becoming an instructional designer for either a college or a corporate company. My dream goal would be to work in a position that combines writing, content creation, graphic design, and/or instructional design.</p>
                <p class="reflection-p-4">Although I no longer aspire to build my career within the field of psychology, I do intend to combine my passion for psychology and well-being with the skills I acquire as I continue my education and pursue new career opportunities. My ultimate goal, aside from my main career, is to create resources that provide guidance on creating and maintaining a happier and healthier lifestyle. I look forward to continuing to collaborate on projects and working with other individuals to provide impactful insight and content in the field of mental health and well-being.</p>
