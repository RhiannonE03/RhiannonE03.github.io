                        <h2> 2025 International Women's Day Collaboration Project </h2> 
                        <p> In March 2025, I received an exciting opportunity and promptly volunteered to participate in a collaborative project for the first time, alongside women from all over the globe. The project brought together 22 women representing different countries, each invited to reflect on and answer the question, “What is one thing every woman should know?” We each chose a personal piece of advice to share, created signs displaying our messages, and submitted photographs to be compiled into a unified and impactful post. The end result provided wonderful pieces of advice not just for women, but for individuals all over the world. </p>
                        <p> This project is not something I would normally volunteer for. However, after taking the initiative to push myself out of my comfort zone, completing this project helped ignite passions that have been lingering in my brain for years. Being a part of this project has been one of the biggest highlights of my year. Following this project, I look forward greatly to the opportunity to participate in another similar project, either with the same creator or another wonderful creator. </p>

                        <h2> Research Paper: Impact of Mindfulness on the Enhancement of Student Engagement and Well-Being </h2> 
                        <p> This paper was written for a previous course I took while pursuing my bachelor’s degree. The prompt for the paper was to select a topic related to positive psychology and discuss how incorporating this subject can alter the current status quo within a specific sector. Guided by my interest in improving well-being, I decided to address the benefits of incorporating mindfulness and meditation practices into education facilities and settings. The paper discusses what mindfulness is, the current status of educational institutions, how mindfulness can be incorporated to improve educational settings, the long-term effects of implementing and engaging in mindfulness practices, and provides a brief description of the connection between mindfulness education and its impact on society. </p>
                        <p> The research required for this paper encouraged me to look outside my usual bounds of well-being and discover how my topics of interest directly impact educational systems. Due to its five-page limit, this paper does not include all the research reviewed nor all the ideas that could have potentially been presented. I believe it would be interesting to conduct further research on this subject. </p>

                        <h2> Substack: rhisworld </h2> 
                        <p> This post reflects a project I am currently pursuing. I have always had an interest in sharing my experiences, lessons, advice, and short personal blurbs, and Substack provides the perfect platform to do so. Writing has consistently been a helpful outlet for processing my emotions and thoughts, especially during difficult periods. This particular post reflects on my struggles with depression and the little daily habits that can help to overcome its weight. As this project is still in its baby stage, current posts are simple reminders, personal stories, and the thoughts that fill my notes app. Future planned posts include longer articles on self-care and wellbeing, combining personal experiences with evidence-based statistics. My next planned post: Do It Scared: how to stop letting fear control your life. </p>
                        <p> This project is something I’m really excited to pursue. Publicly posting personal experiences, advice, and writings is something that is entirely out of my comfort zone. My goal in beginning this is to encourage myself to conduct research on the topics that interest me and to engage and collaborate with other individuals. It is a small step toward my ultimate goal of creating and writing content surrounding topics related to mental, physical, and overall well-being, and being able to offer encouragement, advice, and inspiration to others. </p>
